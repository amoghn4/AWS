AWS Lex and PayPal integration for user login

Retrieve the query string parameters from the event object: If the event object contains the "params" key and "querystring" subkey, the function retrieves the query string parameters and stores them in the query_string_params variable.

Check if the query string contains the authorization code:If the query string contains a "code" parameter, the function exchanges the authorization code for an access token.

Exchange authorization code for an access token: The function constructs a payload with the grant type, authorization code, redirect URI, client ID, and client secret and sends a POST request to PayPal's token endpoint to exchange the authorization code for an access token. 
The access token is then stored in the access_token variable.

Store access token in DynamoDB: The function creates a connection to Amazon DynamoDB and retrieves the specified table. The function then stores the access token in the table with the user ID as the key.

Return a Close dialog action: The function returns a Close dialog action with a fulfillment state of "Fulfilled," a plain text message indicating that the user has successfully logged in with PayPal, and a response card redirecting the user to the PayPal authorization endpoint.

Redirect user to PayPal's authorization endpoint: If the query string does not contain an authorization code, the function constructs the authorization URL with the redirect URI and client ID and returns a Close dialog action with a fulfillment state of "Fulfilled," a plain text message indicating that the user will be redirected to PayPal for authentication, and a response card that displays a button to redirect the user to the PayPal authorization endpoint.
